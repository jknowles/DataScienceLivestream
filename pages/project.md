I am working on building public metrics of government services in the United
States that are available to communities across the country. I am starting with
the criminal justice system for obvious reasons.

My initial quest for data led me to the exhaustive and underutilized Uniform
Crime Report data from the FBI. A research-ready version of this data is hosted
by the [National Archive of Criminal Justice Data](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/)
hosted by [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/).

I will be attempting to estimate expected crime rates for cities in the US and
look for community factors that influence them. There is a lot of discussion about
crime in the US, but much of it is devoid of analysis that community advocates
can use to improve their services locally. I want to fill that void.

I am working on building public metrics of government services in the United
States that are available to communities across the country. I am starting with
the criminal justice system for obvious reasons.

My initial quest for data led me to the exhaustive and underutilized Uniform
Crime Report data from the FBI. A research-ready version of this data is hosted
by the [National Archive of Criminal Justice Data](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/)
hosted by [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/).

### For me

Up front you should know I'm doing this first for me. So if this isn't interesting
to you or you can't fathom why someone would do it, don't worry! For me, doing
this out in the open creates a running log of my work on this project and it
forces me to stay focused and on schedule to keep pushing through the minutiae
of the work. By doing it openly it should force me to be more accountable and to
try my best -- even though it's highly likely no one is watching.

### For you?

Have you ever wondered how other people do data science work? Come watch me
as I struggle and feel better about your own abilities!

Also, I want to demystify the process of data science a bit. A lot of it is
writing code, executing it, thinking about the results, and moving to the next
bit of code. And a lot of Googling.

As I start to make use of the data I am analyzing I hope that having done the
livestream and documented many of my coding decisions, business rules, and
exploratory data analysis will give my work further credibility. I want to
make the process of coming up with useful performance metrics for public services
as transparent as possible and be honest and open about the strengths and weaknesses
of the underlying data and methods.
